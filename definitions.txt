* WebRTC (Web Real Time Communication) *
- is an open source project that enables peer-to-peer communication between browsers or the applications (mobile).
- allows you to exchange any kind of media through the web (such as video, audio and data) without any required plugin or framework.

* Signaling Server * 
- does not do anything that is WebRTC-specific.
- helps to exchange necessary information which are required to establish direct connection between users.
- for signaling we can use whatever we like, from WebSocket to XMLHttpRequest.

* STUN (Session Traversal Utilities for NAT) server * 
- allows clients to discover their public IP address adn the type of NAT they are behind. This information is used to establish the media connection.
- in 15-20% cases STUN server will fail and to establish connection between the peers we will need TURN server.

* TURN (Traversal Using Relay NAT) server * 
- a protocol for relaying network traffic.
- will be used if STUN server will fail.
- will be used as an assist to establish connection between the peers.
- not public because of the traffic which is going through them.

* SDP (Session Description Protocol) * 
- is a format to describing multimedia communication sessions for the purposes of session announcement and session invitation.
- does not deliver the media data but is used for negotiation between peers of various audio and video codecs, source address, timing information of audio and video.
